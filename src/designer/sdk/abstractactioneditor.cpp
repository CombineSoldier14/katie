    \class QDesignerActionEditorInterface

    \brief The QDesignerActionEditorInterface class allows you to
    change the focus of Katie Designer's action editor.

    \inmodule QtDesigner

    The QDesignerActionEditorInterface class is not intended to be
    instantiated directly. You can retrieve an interface to \QD's
    action editor using the
    QDesignerFormEditorInterface::actionEditor() function.

    You can control which actions that are available in the action
    editor's window using the manageAction() and unmanageAction()
    functions. An action that is managed by \QD is available in the
    action editor while an unmanaged action is ignored.

    QDesignerActionEditorInterface also provides the core() function
    that you can use to retrieve a pointer to \QD's current
    QDesignerFormEditorInterface object, and the setFormWindow()
    function that enables you to change the currently selected form
    window.
