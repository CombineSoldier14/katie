=head1 NAME

qdbusxml2cpp - a D-Bus interface generator for Qt-based applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

qdbusxml2cpp [options] [servicename] [path] [method] [args]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

qdbusxml2cpp produces the C++ code to implement the interfaces defined in the
input file.

=head1 OPTIONS

    -a <filename>    Write the adaptor code to <filename>
    -c <classname>   Use <classname> as the class name for the generated classes
    -h               Show this information
    -i <filename>    Add #include to the output
    -l <classname>   When generating an adaptor, use <classname> as the parent class
    -m               Generate #include "filename.moc" statements in the .cpp files
    -N               Don't use namespaces
    -p <filename>    Write the proxy code to <filename>
    -v               Be verbose.
    -V               Show the program version and quit.

If the file name given to the options -a and -p does not end in .cpp or .h, the
program will automatically append the suffixes and produce both files.
You can also use a colon (:) to separate the header name from the source file
name, as in '-a filename_p.h:filename.cpp'.

If you pass a dash (-) as the argument to either -p or -a, the output is written
to the standard output.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

qdbusxml2cpp returns 0 on success and other on unexcepted failure.
