    \class QMutex
    \brief The QMutex class provides access serialization between threads.

    \threadsafe

    \ingroup thread

    The purpose of a QMutex is to protect an object, data structure or
    section of code so that only one thread can access it at a time
    (this is similar to the Java \c synchronized keyword). It is
    usually best to use a mutex with a QMutexLocker since this makes
    it easy to ensure that locking and unlocking are performed
    consistently.

    For example, say there is a method that prints a message to the
    user on two lines:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 0

    If these two methods are called in succession, the following happens:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 1

    If these two methods are called simultaneously from two threads then the
    following sequence could result:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 2

    If we add a mutex, we should get the result we want:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 3

    Then only one thread can modify \c number at any given time and
    the result is correct. This is a trivial example, of course, but
    applies to any other case where things need to happen in a
    particular sequence.

    When you call lock() in a thread, other threads that try to call
    lock() in the same place will block until the thread that got the
    lock calls unlock(). A non-blocking alternative to lock() is
    tryLock().

/*!
    \class QMutexLocker
    \brief The QMutexLocker class is a convenience class that simplifies
    locking and unlocking mutexes.

    \threadsafe

    \ingroup thread

    Locking and unlocking a QMutex in complex functions and
    statements or in exception handling code is error-prone and
    difficult to debug. QMutexLocker can be used in such situations
    to ensure that the state of the mutex is always well-defined.

    QMutexLocker should be created within a function where a
    QMutex needs to be locked. The mutex is locked when QMutexLocker
    is created. You can unlock and relock the mutex with \c unlock()
    and \c relock(). If locked, the mutex will be unlocked when the
    QMutexLocker is destroyed.

    For example, this complex function locks a QMutex upon entering
    the function and unlocks the mutex at all the exit points:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 4

    This example function will get more complicated as it is
    developed, which increases the likelihood that errors will occur.

    Using QMutexLocker greatly simplifies the code, and makes it more
    readable:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 5

    Now, the mutex will always be unlocked when the QMutexLocker
    object is destroyed (when the function returns since \c locker is
    an auto variable).

    The same principle applies to code that throws and catches
    exceptions. An exception that is not caught in the function that
    has locked the mutex has no way of unlocking the mutex before the
    exception is passed up the stack to the calling function.

    QMutexLocker also provides a \c mutex() member function that returns
    the mutex on which the QMutexLocker is operating. This is useful
    for code that needs access to the mutex, such as
    QWaitCondition::wait(). For example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qmutex.cpp 6

    \sa QReadLocker, QWriteLocker, QMutex

/*!
    \fn QMutexLocker::QMutexLocker(QMutex *mutex)

    Constructs a QMutexLocker and locks \a mutex. The mutex will be
    unlocked when the QMutexLocker is destroyed. If \a mutex is zero,
    QMutexLocker does nothing.

    \sa QMutex::lock()
*/

/*!
    \fn QMutexLocker::~QMutexLocker()

    Destroys the QMutexLocker and unlocks the mutex that was locked
    in the constructor.

    \sa QMutex::unlock()
*/

/*!
    \fn QMutex *QMutexLocker::mutex() const

    Returns a pointer to the mutex that was locked in the
    constructor.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QMutexLocker::unlock()

    Unlocks this mutex locker. You can use \c relock() to lock
    it again. It does not need to be locked when destroyed.

    \sa relock()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QMutexLocker::relock()

    Relocks an unlocked mutex locker.

    \sa unlock()
*/

/*!
    \fn QMutex::QMutex(bool recursive)

    Use the constructor that takes a RecursionMode parameter instead.
