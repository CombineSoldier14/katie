/*!
    \class QFileSystemWatcher
    \brief The QFileSystemWatcher class provides an interface for monitoring files and directories for modifications.
    \ingroup io
    \since 4.2
    \reentrant

    QFileSystemWatcher monitors the file system for changes to files
    and directories by watching a list of specified paths.

    Call addPath() to watch a particular file or directory. Multiple
    paths can be added using the addPaths() function. Existing paths can
    be removed by using the removePath() and removePaths() functions.

    QFileSystemWatcher examines each path added to it. Files that have
    been added to the QFileSystemWatcher can be accessed using the
    files() function, and directories using the directories() function.

    The fileChanged() signal is emitted when a file has been modified,
    renamed or removed from disk. Similarly, the directoryChanged()
    signal is emitted when a directory or its contents is modified or
    removed.  Note that QFileSystemWatcher stops monitoring files once
    they have been renamed or removed from disk, and directories once
    they have been removed from disk.
